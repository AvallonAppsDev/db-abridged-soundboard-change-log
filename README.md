# db-abridged-soundboard-change-log
Update 2.1 - (UI and Optimization) -  Mostly Boring tech stuff
- Added moving tabs to allow for more sounds to be added without compromising space for names.
- Removed the issue that allows more than one sound to play at a time.
- Added the option for favourites. Hold on a button to add a sound to your list. Click on the remove from favourites button to remove it. The button will be removed when your restart the app.(Yeah I know it's a pain)
- Added a navigation view to house new features.
- Added an option for suggestions in the navigation view.
- Optimized a bit to shrink file size / prevent it from getting much bigger. There will be more in the future. Image quality might be lower in the future due to this.
- Added a change log button thing.
- Added a bit of vegeta as an extra just to have a sample for you lot.
- New Logo(Again). I think I might finally settle on this one. Or I'll make a fourstar version. IDK.
- Next update will have the rest of veggie prince. Probably tomorrow(June 30th) or Monday(July 1st)
- I think I made some other changes not to sure but screw it.
- I'll probably have the orange hillbilly out by like friday(July 5th 2019) or something.
- Continue to support TFS.

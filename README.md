# db-abridged-soundboard-change-log
 Update 2.4 - Jolly Sanchez bloomers
 - Added sounds for piccolo, bulma and krillin finally.
 - Added additional sounds for vegeta and nappa(for the dude who wanted the ghost nappa sounds I only got to add two for this update  but I will have more for following updates.)
 - Finished optimizing the app so the file size is much smaller(the file size is currently 20.6 mb vs the former 39.1 mb)
 - Added in app purchase to remove ads(I hope it works because I'm very poor and I need the money this could bring lol). I struggled ith the implementation so let me know if it works for you.
 - Next update will either be a villain update or another z fighter update(unsure for now)
 - I have currently begun development on a new game and due to this will no longer be able to focus on this app as much as I used too and as a result I will be releasing updates less frequently.
 - Please SUPPORT THE OFFICIAL RELEASE AND TEAMTHREESTAR.
 
 Update 2.3 - HILLBILLY UPDATEEEEEEEEEEEE!
- Added 34 goku sounds. Sorry for delaying and being lazy... got no reasoning besides that.
- Next update will have either piccolo, cell, roshi, bulma, or freeza. Email me with what you want.
- Keep supporting TFS and the official release.

 Update 2.2 - 40 more veggie sounds
- Added 40 more sounds for veggie boy. I was lazy so I stalled putting this update out.
- Next wednesday will have 25 sounds for goku as well as bulma. Additionally every other week will see a new update for the rest of summer. i.e: the 17th will have an update then the 31st.
- I will finish optimizing for the next update.
- Keep supporting TFS and the official release

 Update 2.1 - (UI and Optimization) -  Mostly Boring tech stuff
- Added moving tabs to allow for more sounds to be added without compromising space for names.
- Removed the issue that allows more than one sound to play at a time.
- Added the option for favourites. Hold on a button to add a sound to your list. Click on the remove from favourites button to remove it. The button will be removed when your restart the app.(Yeah I know it's a pain)
- Added a navigation view to house new features.
- Added an option for suggestions in the navigation view.
- Optimized a bit to shrink file size / prevent it from getting much bigger. There will be more in the future. Image quality might be lower in the future due to this.
- Added a change log button thing.
- Added a bit of vegeta as an extra just to have a sample for you lot.
- New Logo(Again). I think I might finally settle on this one. Or I'll make a fourstar version. IDK.
- Next update will have the rest of veggie prince. Probably tomorrow(June 30th) or Monday(July 1st)
- I think I made some other changes not to sure but screw it.
- I'll probably have the orange hillbilly out by like friday(July 5th 2019) or something.
- Continue to support TFS.
